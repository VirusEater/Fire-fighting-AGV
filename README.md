# Fire fighting AGV
## Idea
This project is about designing a firefighting car. The fire-fighting vehicle is intended to prevent a fire outbreak and extinguish the fire before it gets serious. When the car starts working, it moves around in a particular area to detect if there is a fire. The vehicle is intelligent enough to change its direction to avoid clashing with obstacles when traveling around. When the car sees a fire, it stops, and the buzzer alarms. At the same time, the vehicle will send a warning message. Then, the AGV takes action to extinguish the fire. If the fire is killed, the AGV sends a safe message to a remote device and keeps moving around to detect other fires. If the fire can not be killed, it will send another warning message to the remote device to ask for help.
## Materials
The project used Arduino Mega2560 to control AGV and Jetson Nano to do pattern recognition as well as communication with remote devices. Other materials this project used is shown in the report.
## Code and Video
The code and video can be found in this directory. The video demonstrates the full functions of the AGV.
